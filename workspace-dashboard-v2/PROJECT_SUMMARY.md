# Workspace Dashboard V2 - Project Summary

## ✅ Completed Setup

A fully functional Electron + React + TypeScript application foundation has been created with the following components:

### 1. Project Structure ✅
- Clean separation of concerns (electron/, src/, shared/)
- Modular architecture following "bricks and studs" philosophy
- Self-contained storage module with clear contracts

### 2. Storage Module ✅
- **Location**: `electron/modules/storage/`
- **Features**:
  - SQLite database with better-sqlite3
  - Full CRUD operations for workspaces, projects, and tasks
  - Cascade deletion support
  - Type-safe interfaces
  - Comprehensive test suite
  - Self-contained with README contract documentation

### 3. Electron Main Process ✅
- Main window setup with proper configuration
- IPC communication bridge for storage operations
- Preload script with contextBridge for security
- Development and production build support

### 4. React Frontend ✅
- Basic UI with workspace/project management
- Dark mode support
- Responsive layout with sidebar navigation
- Connected to storage via Electron IPC

### 5. TypeScript Configuration ✅
- Full type safety across all modules
- Shared contracts in `shared/contracts/types.ts`
- Path aliases configured (@shared, @)
- Strict mode enabled

### 6. Build System ✅
- Vite for fast development and building
- Electron Forge for packaging
- Scripts for development, building, and testing
- TypeScript compilation verified

## Available Commands

```bash
# Development
npm run dev          # Start app in development mode

# Building
npm run build        # Build for production
npm run make         # Create distributable packages

# Testing & Quality
npm test            # Run tests
npm run typecheck   # TypeScript type checking
npm run lint        # ESLint checking
```

## Next Steps

The foundation is ready. You can now:

1. **Run the app**: `npm run dev`
2. **Add features**: The modular structure makes it easy to add new modules
3. **Customize UI**: The React frontend is ready for enhancement
4. **Add more storage entities**: Follow the pattern in the storage module
5. **Create distributions**: `npm run make` to create installers

## Architecture Benefits

- **Modular**: Each module is self-contained and replaceable
- **Type-safe**: Full TypeScript coverage prevents runtime errors
- **Testable**: Storage module has comprehensive tests as example
- **Maintainable**: Clear separation of concerns and contracts
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new features following established patterns

The project follows the ruthless simplicity principle - it does exactly what's needed with minimal complexity while maintaining proper architecture.
