# Workspace Dashboard V2 - Design Specification

## Executive Summary

The Workspace Dashboard is a **mental context management system** designed to help developers manage multiple parallel Claude Code sessions without cognitive overload. It provides a visual, spatially-organized canvas where users can track, organize, and quickly context-switch between numerous concurrent development tasks.

## Problem Statement

Managing multiple Claude Code sessions across different terminals and git worktrees creates overwhelming context-switching costs, especially after breaks. Users lose track of:
- What each session was working on
- Which sessions need attention
- What was produced/created
- Their own thoughts and next steps
- Relationships between related work

## Solution Vision

A desktop application providing a grid-based canvas dashboard where each Claude session appears as a card. Users can spatially organize their work, leave notes for themselves, quickly see session states, and fork sessions to explore parallel solutions‚Äîall while maintaining perfect isolation through git worktrees.

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Context Recovery First
Every interface element helps answer: "What was I doing here?" Visual states, personal notes, and clear naming enable instant context recovery.

### 2. Spatial Stability
Users control card placement on a grid. New sessions don't disturb existing layouts. Your mental map remains stable.

### 3. Exploration-Friendly
Easy forking for parallel exploration. Simple disposal of unsuccessful attempts. No penalty for experimentation.

### 4. Reality-Based
Shows actual files in worktrees, real git branches, true session states‚Äînot assumptions or abstractions.

### 5. Progressive Disclosure
- **Glance**: See all states at once
- **Inspect**: Click for details
- **Dive in**: View files, full context

## User Personas

### Primary: Solo Developer
- Managing 5-20 concurrent Claude sessions
- Working across multiple projects simultaneously
- Needs quick context recovery (especially Monday mornings)
- Values experimentation and parallel exploration
- Wants to reduce cognitive load of context switching

- ‚è∏Ô∏è **PAUSED** - Idle but incomplete (TODOs remain)
- ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Finished and reviewed
- üìã **PLANNING** - Initial setup phase

#### State Detection Methods

   - Links to parent visually (optional)

#### Fork Management
- **Visual indication** of parent-child relationships
- **Fork history** tracking
